# genai-multiagent-system

## Description

This repository implements a multi-agent system based on Generative AI (GenAI), grounded in the state-of-the-art documented in ["Estado del Arte: GenAI Agents"]([https://docs.google.com/document/d/1abc123xyz/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13dedG051DTHcbVi1xIPjZ8Q2FcaemCU8Si0RNsV0C94/edit?usp=sharing)). The project explores the practical implementation of modern agent architectures, development frameworks, and advanced prompt engineering techniques.
